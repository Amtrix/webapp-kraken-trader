<h1>How to run</h1>
Create a file "kraken.key.json" in the root directory and add
<pre>
{ key: "your key", secret: "your secret" }
</pre>
This is obviously mandatory to do anything on kraken.

<b>To install:</b> <pre>npm install</pre> in the root directory should do it.
Post Issues if more is needed -- not much motivation on my side to do an installation on a clean OS to get a confident installation guide. :)
